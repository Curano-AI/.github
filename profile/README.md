# CURANO AI

Curano helps Swiss physicians create medical reports — faster, safer, and with less effort.

We use voice input and AI tools to turn clinical notes into structured, high-quality documentation — in seconds.

Our system is fully compliant with FADP, GDPR, and Swiss healthcare data standards.

On average, Curano saves up to 9 hours per week per doctor.

We believe doctors should focus on patients, not paperwork.

That’s why we’re building Curano — with doctors, for doctors.

Less admin. More care.
